🚀 Exploring Vibium for Automation Bots

Over the past week, I dove into Vibium by following their tutorials:
https://github.com/VibiumDev/vibium/blob/main/docs/tutorials/getting-started.md
https://github.com/VibiumDev/vibium/blob/main/docs/tutorials/getting-started-mcp.md

I built my first bot and documented the journey here:

🌐 Portfolio: https://anandhang.github.io/mywebside/

Key Takeaway
While experimenting, I noticed that when resizing the window mid-run, the MCP clicker sometimes fails to locate elements. This was an interesting challenge and gave me deeper insight into how Vibium handles UI automation.

🎥 I’ve attached a short demo video to showcase the bot in action (Click here to see video https://anandhang.github.io/mywebside/).

I’m excited to continue refining this and share more learnings with the QA/automation community. Feedback and suggestions are always welcome!
